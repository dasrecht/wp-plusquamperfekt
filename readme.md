# Plusquamperfekt Wordpress Theme

Based on the:  HTML5 Reset Wordpress Theme

## Summary:

Content Directed Blogging is cool but there weren't much usable themes around. Plusquamperfekt tries to jump in and solve this problem.
It is based on the HTML5 Reset Wordpress theme [HTML5 Reset templates](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset). Which is meant to be a ideal starting point for your own themes.

### Plusquamperfekt brings to the table:

1. A style sheet designed to strip initial files from browsers, meaning you start off with a blank slate.
2. Easy to customize -- remove whatever you don't need, keep what you do.
3. Analytics and jQuery snippets in place
4. Empty mobile and print style sheets, including blocks for device orientation
5. Modernizr.js [http://www.modernizr.com/](http://www.modernizr.com/) enables HTML5 compatibility with IE (and a dozen other great features)
6. IE-specific classes for simple CSS-targeting
7. iPhone/iPad/iTouch icon snippets
8. FOUT Protection
9. Lots of other keen stuff...
